# ASteCA [Automated Stellar Cluster Analysis]

The [ASteCA][1] package is designed to fully automatize the usual tests
applied on [star clusters][2] in order to determine their characteristics:
center, radius, stars membership probabilities and associated
intrinsic/extrinsic parameters: metallicity, age, reddening, distance, total
mass, binarity fraction, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: until the release of v1.0.0 the package will be *under heavy
development*. Keep this in mind if you want to use it in your research.

The latest release can always be accessed [here][5].

The accompanying article describing the code in detail can be accessed
[via A&A][7], and referenced using the following BibTeX entry:
